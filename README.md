# Surfs Up!

## Overview

The primary objective of our analysis was to specifically measure the temperature data trends on the island of Oahu during the months of June and December. We believe that with key metrics of temperature and precipitation  that there is a correlation to the level of success prior to opening a new business of a Surf and Ice-Cream shop. The main theory is if there is sustainable weather year-round with little to no precipitation that we will see an increase in ice cream and surf shop sales.

## Technology Used:
Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, Flask, MatPlotLib

## Results

**June** (based off 1,700 temperature changes)
- Average Temperature = 74.9 °F
- Low Temperature = 64.0°F
- High Temperature = 85.0°F

**December** (based off 1,517 temperature changes)
- Average Temperature = 71.1 °F
- Low Temperature = 56.0°F
- High Temperature = 83.0°F

## Summary

For further analysis I would recommend gathering the amount of precipitation as well as the humidity percentage for the months of June and December.

Based on the following temperature results we would suggest that Oahu does show sustainable temperature year-round that would be consistent with surf shop and ice cream sales for a new business owner.
