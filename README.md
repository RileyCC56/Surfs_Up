# Surfs Up!

## Overview

The primary objective of our analysis was to specifically measure the temperature data trends on the island of Oahu during the months of June and December. We believe that with key metrics of temperature and precipitation  that there is a correlation to the level of success prior to opening a new business of a Surf and Ice-Cream shop. The main theory is if there is sustainable weather year-round with little to no precipitation that we will see an increase in ice cream and surf shop sales.

## Technology Used:
Python, SQL, NumPy, Pandas, Flask, MatPlotLib

## Results

**June** (based off 1,700 temperature changes)
- Average Temperature = 74.9 °F
- Low Temperature = 64.0°F
- High Temperature = 85.0°F

**December** (based off 1,517 temperature changes)
- Average Temperature = 71.1 °F
- Low Temperature = 56.0°F
- High Temperature = 83.0°F

## Summary

Based on the following temperature results and summary statistics, we would suggest that Oahu does show sustainable temperature year-round that would be consistent with surf shop and ice cream sales for a new business owner. 

For further analysis to strongly evaluate our theory, I would recommend gathering the daily precipitation as well as the humidity percentage daily reports for the months of June and December to determine if the rainfall does show a significant difference between sales on rainy days compared to sunny days. As history does show, the islands of Hawaii does bring rainfall but the locals will always make time to go surfing and enjoy ice cream at the end of the day.
