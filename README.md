# Surfs Up!

## Overview

The following analysis primary objective was to specifically measure the temperature data trends on Oahu within the months of June and December prior to opening a surf shop. We believe that with this data that there is a correlation between the temperature on Oahu and the success of a surf shop and ice cream shop. The main theory is that is there is sustainable weather year-round with little to no precipitation that we will see an increase in ice cream and surf shop sales.

## Results

**June** (based off 1,700 temperature changes)
- Average Temperature = 74.9 °F
- Low Temperature = 64.0°F
- High Temperature = 85.0°F

**December** (based off 1,517 temperature changes)
- Average Temperature = 71.1 °F
- Low Temperature = 56.0°F
- High Temperature = 83.0°F

## Summary

For further analysis I would recommend gathering the amount of precipitation as well as the humidity percentage for the months of June and December.

Based on the following temperature results we would suggest that Oahu does show sustainable temperature year-round that would be consistent with surf shop and ice cream sales for a new business owner.
